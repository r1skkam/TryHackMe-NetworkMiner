# NetworkMiner
`Learn how to use NetworkMiner to analyse recorded traffic files and practice network forensics activities.`

## Task 1 Room Introduction
[TryHackMe | Network Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/network-fundamentals)

## Task 2 Introduction to Network Forensics
### Introduction to Network Forensics
The investigation tries to answer the 5W;
1. Who (Source IP and port)
2. What (Data/payload)
3. Where (Destination IP and port)
4. When (Time and data)
5. Why (How/What happened)

### Network Forensics Use Cases
The most common network forensics use cases are explained below;
1. Network discovery
2. Packets reassembling
3. Data leakage detection
4. Anomaly and malicious activity detection
5. Policy/Regulation compliance control

### Advantages of Network Forensics
General advantages of network forensics are explained below;
1. Availability of network-based evidence in the wild
2. Ease of data/evidence collection without creating noise
3. It is hard to destroy the network evidence, as it is the transferred data
4. Availability of log sources
5. It is possible to gather evidence for memory and non-residential malicious activities

### Challenges of Network Forensics
General challenges of the network forensics are explained below;
1. Deciding what to do
2. Sufficient data/evidence collection on the network
3. Short data capture
4. The unavailability of full-packet capture on suspicious events
5. Encrypted traffic
6. GDPR and Privacy concerns in traffic recording
7. Nonstandard port usage
8. Time zone issues
9. Lack of logs

### Sources of Network Forensics Evidence
There are multiple evidence resources to gather network forensics data.
1. TAPS
2. InLine Devices
3. SPAN Ports
4. Hubs
5. Switches
6. Routers
7. DHCP Servers
8. Name Servers
9. Authentication Servers
10. Firewalls
11. Web Proxies
12. Central Log Servers
13. Logs(IDS/IPS, Application, OS, Device

### Primary Purposes of Network Forensics
There are three main data types investigated in Network Forensics
1. Live Traffic
2. Traffic Captures (full packet captures and network flows)
3. Log Files
